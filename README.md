# slowhttp
A very slow HTTP service designed to play a harmless prank on script kiddies scanning your server.
This service is developed in Rust, but don't worry if you're unfamiliar with Rust. It's ready to use out of the boxâ€”just download the release corresponding to your CPU architecture, unzip it, and execute it.

```
Parameters:
--port: The port number to bind the service (default is 8080).
--message: The message to send to the other party (default: international friendly message).
--times: The number of repetitions.

For example:
./slowhttp --port 8000 --message "Don't mess with me!" --times 60
```

# First, configure an upstream in your Nginx configuration.
```
upstream slow {
server 127.0.0.1:8080;
}
```

# Then, set up a location block to proxy requests to the upstream.

```
location /phpinfo.php {
proxy_pass http://slow;
}
```

With this configuration, when script kiddies scan your server, theyâ€™ll receive your friendly greeting! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
